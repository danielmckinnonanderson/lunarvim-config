# Lunarvim Config

Finally had the time to centralize my Lunarvim config and get my development environments in roughly the same shape across all three platforms I develop on.
This config relies on a switch statement checking the operating system at the beginning of the config.

I will likely move this remote repo to a more complete repo of my dotfiles if I determine that that is feasible given, again, the different platforms I use.

Feel free to fork and modify this config for your own use.
